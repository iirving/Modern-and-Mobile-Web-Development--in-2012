Mod Web Dev 

  Design in a Moblie world

    A Major Desgin Issue is the the proliferation of devices and screens,
        > 5 years ago you worried about the Desktop (23") and Latop {17"), and maybe (but not really) the occuaisally BB - not really becuase few non C*O's had them or used them to acess the web.

      and we had a resonable grap on how to design for those designs,  mosttly Static layouts from 960 px to 1200 px wide.

      
      We mostly built the static layout with html Tables (That's how I did it in 1999)
        a Row for the Header, a Row for top nav, 
        <table>
          <tr><td colspan=3>Header</td></tr>
          <tr><td colspan=3>Top Nav</td></tr>
          <tr>
             <td width="100px">Secondary Nav<td>
             <td>Content</td>
             <td>possible side bar</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td colspan=3>Footer</td></tr>
        </table>
        
        (I felt dirty just writing that)  
        
        Another common use for table layout is lining up FORM elements with their labels. 
        
        
        



   if companies bothered to think/develop for mobile devices you sub doained a m.yourdomian.com (or yourdomian.com/m) , developeed a spertate site, with simplyed content and functionality.  

and since the iphone came out, 5 years ago, that has been "the plan" for mobile 

       Today we have 100's of milliions of (at mininum) devices, each at a diferent size : iPhones, iPod Touchs, iPads (soon a 7" mini iPad, maybe); Android phones, Andriod Tables, plus the "older" Laptops (11" to 17") and desktops (23" to 33") and  Google glasses, and Retina Displays

      and the next billion devices on the web with be "smart" phones or Tablets and Pads (all < 11")

     we are in a "Post Pc" world now.  

     how do you developed a web site that "works" on all those layouts without going crazy? 

    (insert here graphic of Ian pulling out the rest of his hair)

    Well a few things did change since 1999
    
2001    http://www.alistapart.com/articles/practicalcss/ Tables are Dead... 

From Table Hacks to CSS Layout: A Web Designer’s Journey (2001)
http://www.alistapart.com/articles/journey/
    
        We now use CSS grid layouts 

        <div class="container">
          <div id="header">Header<div>
          <div id="nav">Top Nav</div>
  
             <Div id="secondary">Secondary Nav<div>
             <div id="content" class="article">Content</div>
             <div id="sidebar" class"section">possible side bar</div>
        
          <div id="footer">Footer</div>
        </div>
        
        Show some CSS Zen Garden Layouts http://www.csszengarden.com/
 


These was a a big improvement  
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/04/14/designing-with-grid-based-approach/

so there were soon a flood of CSS frameworks with the benefits of

A easy to use grid
A Sensible default typography and styling baseline
A  browser CSS reset
A stylesheet for printing

and the biggest difference being the size of the grid (920px, 1024px 1140px were commonly used ) and the number of columns (4 or 12 or 16 )
and there are even grid generators (plug in your total width, and number of max number of columns and BINGO! U Haz Layout)

BluePrint http://blueprintcss.org/ come out in 2007 and I started using it right away (it was way better that want I had evolved on my own)


but these were still Static grids! and after 2007 ( January 9 it be precise) is was become more and more obvious that we had a problem

Now their had been some crazy people as far back as at least 2001 and 2002 wo talked about "elastic design" 

 (http://www.alistapart.com/articles/flexiblelayouts/)

example

Dug Falby at http://www.donkeyontheedge.com/ala.html  (show on tab)

or Eric Costello http://glish.com/css/


But they were ignored by Clients and developers (like me) who where  used to static or even print layouts




around 2010 we  elastic or fluid layouts revisited and from this was born responsive layout

http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/

   Part of the solution is "Responive Desgin"

     the goal is "Look Great on any Device"
     https://developers.facebook.com/html5/blog/post/4/
     

   How? by using 

       1. A flexible grid-based layout  :     The layout of a website can shift and adapt to changes in screen size and device capability with Fluid Grids 
        2.Media queries  CSS3 Media Queries and JavaScript tools that adapt with real-time Feature detection

     Note : Responsive is good even if you are only targeting Mobile! i.e 3" iPhones; 4.5" Android; 7" Nexus Tablet; 9" iPad
     
        
    challenges :
       
       Design Navigation that works on 3" as well as >9"

      Using Native Mobile app Look and Feel in your web app
      
         why ? becuase most people expect iit to look and act like the app's they have installed.  
         Act similar and have to deal with less learning / training
         and most of the UX from native app is very very good

  JavaScript
  
  
  the rise of AJAX
  
  
 unobtrusive Javascript : 
       
   Just as CSS allowed us to remove layout from the markup, unobtrusive JS allows you to separation of functionality (the "behavior layer") from a Web page's structure/content and presentation

rather than lots of inline javascript:  
      <input type="text" name="date" onchange="validateDate()" />  
        
 you do more of 
 
 <input type="text" name="date" id="date" />       
   
   window.onload = function() {
    document.getElementById('date').onchange = validateDate;
};

        the Views may be built in embedded language pages HTML markup 
            Java (.jsp), Ruby (.erb) , PHP (.php) , c# (.asp)
         or they use a Logic-less Template (Mustache, Handlebars, Closure Templates )
         
         Handlebars Js example
         
         combine : 
         
	     <div class="entry">
  		   <h1>{{title}}</h1>
  		   <div class="body">
    		  {{{body}}}
  		   </div>
	     </div>
	      and this data context :
	      
	      {
             title: "All about <p> Tags",
             body: "<p>This is a post about &lt;p&gt; tags</p>"
           }
	
	      and get :
	      
	      <div class="entry">
             <h1>All About &lt;p&gt; Tags</h1>
             <div class="body">
                <p>This is a post about &lt;p&gt; tags</p>
